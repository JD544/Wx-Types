# Wx types - Additional types for Wx

This library contains additional types for the Wx IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
It adds several useful types that are not included in the default Wx IDE, and also allows you to create your own custom types.

## Installation
To install this library, simply head over to the Extensions tab in the Wx IDE and search for "Wx types". or simply tap upload and copy this repo url into the box and then tap install.

## Usage
Once installed, you can use the types in your Wx scripts by importing them. For example:
```
const editor: Editor = prop.monacoInstance // Assigns the correct editor type to the variable
```

You do not need to import the types, as they are automatically imported when you install the Extension.
